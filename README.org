Simple netcat(1) alternative in C using sockets.

Some interesting resources about networking:

* Building

To build the project, simply clone the repository and run =make=.

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/8dcc/snc
$ cd snc
$ make clean all
...
#+end_src

Optionally, if you want to install the program in your system, use the =install=
target.

#+begin_src console
$ sudo make install
...
#+end_src

* Usage

The help can be shown with the =h= command.

#+begin_src console
$ snc h
Usage:
    snc h       - Show this help.
    snc r       - Start in "receive" mode.
    snc t <IP>  - Transmit to specified IP address.
#+end_src

To receive data from another machine, start the program in /receive/ mode. It will
start to listen, and print received data to =stdout=.

#+begin_src console
$ snc l
...

$ snc l > output.txt
#+end_src

To transmit data to another machine, start the program in /transmit/ mode. It will
read data from =stdin=, transmit it to the specified IP address.

#+begin_src console
$ snc c IP
Type stuff here!
...
It will send it to the receiver.

$ snc c IP < input.txt
#+end_src

The port for receiving and transmitting is hard-coded (as a macro) in the [[file:src/main.c][main.c]]
source.
