To receive data from another machine, start the program in /receive/ mode. It will
start to listen, and print received data to =stdout=.

#+begin_src console
$ snc --receive
...

$ snc -r > output.txt
#+end_src

To transmit data to another machine, start the program in /transmit/ mode. It will
read data from =stdin=, transmit it to the specified IP address.

#+begin_src console
$ snc --transmit "IP"
Type stuff here!
...
It will send it to the receiver.

$ snc -t "IP" < input.txt
#+end_src
